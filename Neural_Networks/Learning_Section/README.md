Welcome to today's session on A.I. and Machine Learning Fundamentals: Neural Networks!

Before we go deep into today's session, let's first cover some of the basic definitions of terms you'll hear frequently used today.

- A.I. or Artifical Intelligence, Britannica Definition: The ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. 

- ML or Machine Learning, MIT Sloan Definition: Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence, which is broadly defined as the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior. Artificial intelligence systems are used to perform complex tasks in a way that is similar to how humans solve problems.

- Neural Networks, IBM Definition: A neural network is a machine learning program, or model, that makes decisions in a manner similar to the human brain, by using processes that mimic the way biological neurons work together to identify phenomena, weigh options and arrive at conclusions.

- What is the difference between A.I. and Machine Learning? According to Google, artificial intelligence encompasses the idea of a machine that can mimic human intelligence, machine learning does not. Machine learning aims to teach a machine how to perform a specific task and provide accurate results by identifying patterns. 

To help with our lesson today, we'll use the most common image recognition and learning method used in machine learning and that is recognizing numbers from hand drawn images maintained by the mnist database. Our good friends NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) have compiled thousands of handwritten images of numbers.
